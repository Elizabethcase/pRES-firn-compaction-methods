# Codebase for Phase-sensitive radar as a tool for measuring firn compaction

This code reproduces the figures and provides the code for the methods and model as described in Case E and Kingslake J. (2021). Phase-sensitive radar as a tool for measuring firn compaction. 

Description is forthcoming, but the code is somewhat commented. Please feel free to email me with any questions at ehc2150 [at] columbia [dot] edu.
