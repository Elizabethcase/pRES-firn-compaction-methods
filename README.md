# Firn densification

This repository stores all the (python) code I'm working on related to firn densification. In particular, we are looking at

1. extracting a firn compaction signal from ApRES
2. investigating accuulation and temperature sensitivities 
    - analytically
    - numerically
    
    Eventually, this project will have its own .yml. All end products can be visualized in accompanying jupyter noteboks, although the goal is to code in good form and use scripts for funcitons, parameters, etc. Refer to the help files in each folder for more specific information.
